    <p>
      The puppet-filled story of a recent college grad named Princeton, who
      moves into a shabby New York apartment all the way out on Avenue Q. He
      soon discovers that, although the residents seem nice, it's clear that
      this is not your ordinary neighborhood. Together, Princeton and his
      new-found friends struggle to find jobs, dates and their ever-elusive
      purpose in life. Presented by Canterbury Theatre Guild.
