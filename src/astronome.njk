          <p>I was a designer on a team of three (myself, <a href="https://www.margauxthw.com/" rel="friend met">Margaux Thwaites</a>, and <a href="https://monicayunagee.com/" rel="friend met">Monica Gee</a>). My responsibilities included research, ideation, user testing, and UI design.</p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>AstronoMe is a mobile-based solution targeting the pre-trip mental health of space tourists set in the future. The concept’s focus on mental health narrows in on fear and anxieties, taking users through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">5 whys</a> guided discovery process. The concept integrates a mixed reality experience to create a sense of immersion and effectively visualise links amongst a user’s insights. AstronoMe was conceived as a mobile app to provide privacy, accessibility and a quick experience that users can keep coming back to.
